Number Guessing Game in Javascript
Using whatever technology you are most comfortable with create a guessing game application, the app should start with prompting the user to enter a range for the computer to think of a number. 0 - 100, 0 - 10 etc

Then the app should prompt the user to guess the number it is thinking of.

And with each guess instruct the user if their guess is lower or higher until
the user gets the number, then present them with how many times it took them to guess the number.
